1276. Number of Burgers with No Waste of Ingredients: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-burgers-with-no-waste-of-ingredients/description/

This programming question is just a thinly-veiled math question at the end of the day, and an easy one at that.  Don't worry if you didn't
get it though.  

This question is as easy as imagining a cartesian grid spanning -inf to +inf with two lines drawn acrossed it.  The 
coordinates of where the lines intersect is the number of jumbo burgers and the number of small burgers, respectively.  If s is the number of 
cheese slices and y is the number of tomoato slices, these are the two equations:

2(y-α) + 4(α) = x
2(α) + 4(y-α) = x

We are varying an alpha value ranging from α = 0 to α = the number of tomato slices.

Solving for the first equation we get:

α = (x-2y)/2

Solving for the second equation we get:

α = (x-4y)/-2

These equations represent the x and y coordinates of the intersection, respectively.  The final part of this problem is to make sure that
these two values are integers, not floats.  In this case we can use the math.isclose() function to make sure of this.  If the ratio of 
cheese slices to tomato slices is or less than 4, then a solution is not feasable.  If the math.isclose() function comes true, then we 
turn the coordinate pair (int(x), int(y)).


```python
import math
class Solution:
    def numOfBurgers(self, tomatoSlices: int, cheeseSlices: int) -> List[int]:
        if 2*cheeseSlices > tomatoSlices or  4*cheeseSlices < tomatoSlices:
            return []
        x = (tomatoSlices - 2*cheeseSlices)/2
        y = (tomatoSlices - 4*cheeseSlices)/-2
        if math.isclose(x, int(x)) and math.isclose(y, int(y)):
            return [int(x), int(y)]
        return []
```
