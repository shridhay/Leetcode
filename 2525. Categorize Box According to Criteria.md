2525. Categorize Box According to Criteria: https://leetcode.com/problems/categorize-box-according-to-criteria/description/

Absolutely perfect candidate for a match statment, read the prompt and that is that.  Also boolean assigment in python is rad.  
The code below is quite readable if you know what a match statement is.

```python
  def categorizeBox(self, length: int, width: int, height: int, mass: int) -> str:
      bulky = (max([length, width, height, mass]) >= 10000) or ((length*width*height) >= 1000000000)
      heavy = (mass >= 100)
      match (bulky, heavy):
          case (True, True):
              return "Both"
          case (False, False):
              return "Neither"
          case (True, False):
              return "Bulky"
          case (False, True):
              return "Heavy"
 ```
