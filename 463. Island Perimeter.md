463. Island Perimeter: https://leetcode.com/problems/island-perimeter/description/

Very simple double for-loop traversal, nothing more nothing less, if the square you selected is on an edge up the counter by one, if the square you selected is at a corner, up the counter by 2, if the square you selected does not have a neighbor in any cardnial direction, up the counter by a proportional amount.

```python
    def islandPerimeter(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[i][j] == 1:
                    if i == 0:
                        count += 1
                    else:
                        if grid[i-1][j] == 0:
                            count += 1
                    if j == 0:
                        count += 1
                    else:
                        if grid[i][j-1] == 0:
                            count += 1
                    if i == len(grid) - 1:
                        count += 1
                    else:
                        if grid[i+1][j] == 0:
                            count += 1
                    if j == len(grid[0]) - 1:
                        count += 1
                    else:
                        if grid[i][j+1] == 0:
                            count += 1
        return count
