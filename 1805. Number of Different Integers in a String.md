1805. Number of Different Integers in a String: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-different-integers-in-a-string/description/

Pretty doable, the int() function is able parse numbers with leading zeros ie. 019 becomes 19.  Set.add function will not add extra members
if the member already resides within the set.  We have an intermediate string that collects digits that is being parsed in the central for 
loop in the curr string. A digit is identified if it is a member of the digits set.  If we identify a character of the word string we will 
immediately attempt add the current digit string storred in curr to the nums set.  We will then clear the curr string and continue 
iterating.  Penultimately, we will add curr to the nums set one last time, in the case that the word string ends with a number. Finally,
the function returns the length of the nums set.  Runtime: O(n).

```python
def numDifferentIntegers(self, word: str) -> int:
    digits = set(['0','1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'])
    nums = set()
    curr = ''
    for i in range(len(word)):
        if word[i] in digits:
            curr += word[i]
        else:
            if curr:
                nums.add(int(curr))
            curr = ''
    if curr:
        nums.add(int(curr))
    return len(nums)
```
