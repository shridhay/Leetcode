704. Binary Search: https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-search/description/

Pretty straight forward, run-of-the-mill binary search on an array.  Pick a pivot point in the middle element of the array.  If the pivot point is less than the target, set the low end to the element after the pivot.  If the pivot point is greater than the target, set the high end to the element before the pivot.  If the pivot point is the target, return the index of the pivot.  If none of the above, the target is not in the array.  Runtime complexity is O(log(n)), space complexity is O(n).

```python
def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
    lo = 0
    hi = len(nums)-1
    while lo <= hi:
        mid = (hi + lo) // 2
        if nums[mid] < target:
            lo = mid + 1
        elif nums[mid] > target:
            hi = mid - 1
        else:
            return mid
    return -1
```
