2579. Count Total Number of Colored Cells: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-total-number-of-colored-cells/description/

Cool Fractal/Recurrence relation problem.  My first stab at the problem was to use Dynamic Programming, as so:
```python
def coloredCells(self, n: int) -> int:
    L = [1] * (n+1)
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        L[i] = L[i-1] + 4*(i-1)
    return L[n]
```
O(n), but we can do better.

There is a very easy numerical based solution as so:
```python
def coloredCells(self, n: int) -> int:
    return 2 * (n * (n-1)) + 1 
```
O(1), not bad...

This solution can also be solved using bitwise operations as such:
```python
def coloredCells(self, n: int) -> int:
    n = n * (n-1)
    return (n << 1) | 1
```
Very clean, except for the  n = n * (n-1) line, but still O(1), I am satisfied enough to move along...
