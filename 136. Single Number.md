136. Single Number: https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/description/

I was able to develop 2 dictionary-based solutions and one special XOR based solution to this Problem:

Solution #1:

This solution involves mapping all of the unique elements in nums to the frequency to which they appear in the nums array.  We then return th
the first key in the nums array that is not equal to 2.  This solution is O(n) time and O(n) space complexity:

```python
def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    counter = {}
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if not nums[i] in counter:
            counter[nums[i]] = 0
        counter[nums[i]] += 1
    for i in counter:
        if counter[i] != 2:
            return i
```

Solution #2:


```python
def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    counter = {}
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if not nums[i] in counter:
            counter[nums[i]] = 1
        else:
            del counter[nums[i]]
    return list(counter.keys())[0]
```

Solution #3:

```python
def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    sigma = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        sigma = sigma ^ nums[i]
    return sigma
```
