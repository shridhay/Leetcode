136. Single Number: https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/description/

I was able to develop 2 dictionary-based solutions and one special XOR based solution to this Problem:

Solution #1:

This solution involves mapping all of the unique elements in nums to the frequency to which they appear in the nums array.  We then return the first key in the nums array that is not equal to 2.  This solution is O(n) time and O(n) space complexity:

```python
def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    counter = {}
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if not nums[i] in counter:
            counter[nums[i]] = 0
        counter[nums[i]] += 1
    for i in counter:
        if counter[i] != 2:
            return i
```

Solution #2:

This solution is quite similar to the one above.  We iterate through all of the elements of the nums array.  Through the traversal, if the
element is not already in the Counter dictionary, we will add it to the counter dictionary.  If the elemen tis not already in the Counter
dictionary, we will remove it from the counter dictionary.  The remaining element after the traversal is the single element in the nums array.

```python
def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    counter = {}
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if not nums[i] in counter:
            counter[nums[i]] = 1
        else:
            del counter[nums[i]]
    return list(counter.keys())[0]
```

Solution #3:

Before diving into this next solution, I would check out this article: https://florian.github.io/xor-trick/ .  XOR'ing two identical values 
gives a value of 0.  XOR'ing any value with 0, besides 0 gives you back the value you XOR'd 0 with initially.  Since there are two of each
number in the nums array except for one of the numbers, if we were to elementwise XOR all of the elements of the nums array together, we
would get the number that only appears once in the nums array.  The code below demonstrates this:

```python
def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    sigma = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        sigma = sigma ^ nums[i]
    return sigma
```
