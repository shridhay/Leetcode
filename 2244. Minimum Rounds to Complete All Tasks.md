Here is my Python solution for Minimum Round to Complete All Tasks.  I utilized a 1D Dynamic Programming approach as well as a Dictionary/Hashmaps that maps values from the tasks to the frequency at which they appear in the tasks list.  Enjoy!

```python3
def minimumRounds(self, tasks: List[int]) -> int:
    counter = {}
    dp = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]
    for i in range(len(tasks)):
        if not tasks[i] in counter:
            counter[tasks[i]] = 0
        counter[tasks[i]] += 1
    for i in range(5, max(counter.values()) + 1):
        dp.append(1 + min(dp[i-2], dp[i-3]))
    return -1 if 1 in counter.values() else sum([dp[i] for i in counter.values()]
```
