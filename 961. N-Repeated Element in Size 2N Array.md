961. N-Repeated Element in Size 2N Array: https://leetcode.com/problems/n-repeated-element-in-size-2n-array/description/

We are garuenteed that the number that we would like to identifiy is in the Array.  So we can just run a frequency counter in a hashmap 
to track the frequency that the number appears in the nums array.  O(n) solution, I would be very suprised if a faster solution were possible.  Enjoy!

```python
    def repeatedNTimes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        counter = {}
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if not nums[i] in counter:
                counter[nums[i]] = 0
            counter[nums[i]] += 1
            if counter[nums[i]] == (len(nums)//2):
                return nums[i]
```
