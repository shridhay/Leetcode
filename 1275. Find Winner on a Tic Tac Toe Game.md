1275. Find Winner on a Tic Tac Toe Game: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-winner-on-a-tic-tac-toe-game/description/

Again, typical 2D matrix iteration.  Player A is marked with +1 and Player B is marked with -1.  Player A winning will be +3 along a row, 
column, major diagonal, or minor diagonal.  Player B winning will be a -3 along a row, column, major diagonal, or minor diagonal.  The Order I did it is: 1) Checked the rows 2) Checked the columns 3) Checked the major diagonal and checked the minor diagonal.  

```python
 def tictactoe(self, moves: List[List[int]]) -> str:
      matrix = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
      for k in range(len(moves)):
          marker = 1 if k % 2 == 0 else -1
          matrix[moves[k][0]][moves[k][1]] = marker
          for i in range(len(matrix)):
              if sum(matrix[i]) == 3:
                  return "A"
              if sum(matrix[i]) == -3:
                  return "B"
          for i in range(len(matrix)):
              if sum([matrix[j][i] for j in range(len(matrix))]) == 3:
                  return "A"
              if sum([matrix[j][i] for j in range(len(matrix))]) == -3:
                  return "B"
          if sum([matrix[i][i] for i in range(len(matrix))]) == 3:
              return "A"
          if sum([matrix[i][i] for i in range(len(matrix))]) == -3:
              return "B"
          if sum([matrix[2-i][i] for i in range(len(matrix))]) == 3:
              return "A"
          if sum([matrix[2-i][i] for i in range(len(matrix))]) == -3:
              return "B"
      return "Draw" if len(moves) == 9 else "Pending"
  ```
