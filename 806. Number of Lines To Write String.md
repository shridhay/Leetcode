806. Number of Lines To Write String: https://leetcode.com/problems/goat-latin/description/

Extremely cut-and-dry solution here.  Split the sentence on spaces, make the appropriate modifications through a for-loop, and then 
recombine and return at the end of the program.  Used the vowels set to quickly and efficiently check for membership while iterating
through the for-loop. O(n) runtime.

```python
def toGoatLatin(self, sentence: str) -> str:
    sentence = sentence.split()
    vowels = set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'])
    for i in range(len(sentence)):
        if sentence[i][0] in vowels:
            sentence[i] = sentence[i] + "ma" + 'a'*(i + 1)
        else:
            sentence[i] = sentence[i][1:] + sentence[i][0] + "ma" + 'a'*(i + 1)
    return " ".join(sentence)
```
